# The-First-Step
My first repository on GitHub.
I'm an individual highly interested in computer programming, coding, entrepreneurship and finance.
I'm pretty new to most advance knowledge about those subjects but I can be highly adaptive and quick to learn, not to mention creative in my own interpretation's as I am gaining the needed and said knowledge.
Willing to hear and very open minded to opinions and information so please do be friendly and willing to share thoughts, ideas and personal knowledge.
